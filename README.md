# Hackathon Prep
Prep for [SteelHacks 2019](http://steelhacks.com/), a [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) hackathon. \
will be keeping tutorials and stuff [on my website](https://daedalus1235.github.io/hackprep/hpindex). Maybe I'll make it need a password later. Maybe I'll make this a private reposit- oh, wait.



## Languages
Back-end will most likely be Python or C++ due to versatility and support. Front end will be either a gui for application or HTML/PHP/JS for web app

## APIs
- TensorFlow for Machine Learning
- OpenCV for Computer Vision
- SDL2.0 for C++ GUI
- Tkinter or Kivy for Python GUI

## Resources

: Looks like a solid three-hour foundation for TensorFlow. I'll be able to confirm that statement when I have three hours. ~ @ntokala
